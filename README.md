### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am Subhodip Biswas, a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech. Experienced researcher with expertise in derivate-free optimization, spatiotemporal data mining, graph algorithms, machine learning and urban computing. Expected to graduate in summer of 2021:

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for **full-time data/research scientist** roles in industrial R&D

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a **Journeyman Fellow** sponsored by [DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory](https://www.orau.org/arlfellowship/default.htm) Research Associateship Program working on developing [Bayesian Optimization](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/) techniques for applications like hyperparameter optimization, Reinforcement Learning-based controllers, expensive engineering simulations, and so on.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about _model-based_ and _inverse reinforcement learning_

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The best way to reach me is [email](mailto:subhodip@cs.vt.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/subhodip-biswas/)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: One of my PhD dissertation works received the **best-paper award** at [ACM SIGSPATIAL 2020](https://sigspatial2020.sigspatial.org/program/)
